## [Save: Password-Tester](https://funmbia.github.io/Save-Password-Tester/index.html)

6️⃣ A password classification system, categorizing user passwords into one of six tiers, ranging from 0 to 5.     
⚖️ This classification process is informed by attributes such as _commonality_, _ordering_, _uniqueness_, and _length_.     
💪 Users are presented with the option to enhance their password security by following tailored suggestions to elevate their password to a Tier 5 classification.     
🎲 Additionally, users have the choice to generate a new password, either through random generation or by responding to personalized questions.    
    

### Additional features to implement:  </br>
📕 Dictionary API for the random password generation feature (e.g. get a personal API key from [Wordnik](https://developer.wordnik.com/)) </br>
